# Community Engagement
### Asbury Elementary School

During my time at DU I was fortunate enough to participate in the Pioneer Leadership Program and one of the requirements for Freshman students is to pick a local organization that interests you and commit to volunteering with them throughout the year. The organization that I picked was a school right down the street from DU, Asbury Elementary School. For awhile I have had a looming interest in being an educator and I think that is partially what guided me to volunteer at a school that would allow me to explore this interest in a little more depth. <img align = "right" src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98546888/161779438-f886e853-054d-46fd-8b03-1d109b40c77f.png" alt = "drawing" width = "300"/>My volunteer time here involved helping in a first grade classroom and taking part in activities such as reading and writing lessons, grading, and creative projects. I am fairly positive that any of the students that I worked with would now longer remember me but watching their development, even in one short year, was incredibly rewarding for me and reminded me of the importantance of education. 

After completeing my volunteer time at Asbury I reached a few conclusions. I am still very interested in being involved in education and even though my degree does not directly cater to that interest, I can find ways to be involved without being a teacher. Another significant takeaway was that volunteering within a community is an invaluable way to get to know the community. I grew up in a very small town and never really moved so I got to know my community really well as I was growing up. When I came to DU this aspect of my life was relatively uprooted in a sense as I tried to familiarize myself with new places, people, and ways of life. Volunteering at Asbury provided a thorough understanding of the community around DU and helped me acclimate quickly. This is an idea I would like to keep in mind wherever I end up in the future. 

### Community Change Initiative


As part of my course work for the Pioneer Leadership Program, I participated in a group Community Change Initiative. The purpose of this project was to identify a challenge facing the local community that is important to you and create an initiative that seeks to address this challenge in some way or another. Every member of my group played sports in high school and we all felt as though those experience were crucial to our development and joy as adolescents; additionally, we recognized a concerning trend related to youth mental health nationwide and specifically in Denver. Thus, we decide to approach the challenge of mental health struggles in youth populations by way of physical activity. 

This project took us all over the Denver metro area as we interviewed stakeholders from every corner of our identified challenge. We talked to the principal of Columbine High School who was at the helm during the Columbine shooting. We interviewed the Colorado Rockies community outreach leaders in a conference room that overlooks Coors Field. We also spent many hours writing emails that never received responses and watched stakeholder relationships that were once promising, fizzle into nothing. On top of that, the onset of COVID-19 shut down our school and many of the organizations we were working with just as the project was beginning to get rolling. Nevertheless, the experience we gained from this project was invaluable. 

Possibly my most significant takeaway from the Community Change Initiative was just how hard it can be to get a grassroots project off the ground. There are so many variables to consider and so many stakeholders to talk to that important factors can easily fall through the cracks and crucial relationships can break down if they are not given the proper care and attention. On the more positive side, however, the project also helped me to realize how many people care about the issues that are facing their communities and community change rarely fails because of a lack of numbers but rather a lack of commitment or organization. Being effective in this field is reliant upon organizing these numbers to optimize the impact you can make.

# Leadership

Throughout high school I frequently found myself pursuing and upholding leadership positions through athletics, student council, and other student organizations. As I approached graduation I was unsure of what my leadership future would look like, but then I received an invitation to apply for the Pioneer Leadership Program at the University of Denver. At that time I knew very little about the program but I had friends that participated in it and they encouraged me to apply while I adopted the "Why not" mindset. 

I have recently completed the coursework to earn a Leadership Studies minor via the Pioneer Leadership Program and while it has had its ups and downs, I am grateful for the step that PLP provided in my leadership journey. I had a realization that much of my leadership knowledge before college was rooted in experience. My understanding of leadership and perception of the techniques required of the tasks came from positions I upheld and the events I coordinated in those roles and while this is not a bad thing, I did not spend significant time really considering what leadership is and what it meant to me. PLP provided this opportunity. 

I stepped back from leadership roles and instead focused my attention on leadership theory and philosophy which gave me the opportunity to analyze the big picture, explore new ideas, and consider how I could develop my definition of leadership. <img align = "left" src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98546888/161780231-41d0aa33-a76c-45a8-990c-debab4400338.jpeg" alt = "drawing" width = "300"/>Whereas my high school understanding of leadership felt pretty standard and likely conformed to the most common definition of leadership, I now feel confident in saying that my understanding has become significantly more complex and thought out. My definition now includes words such as vulnerability, creativity, and authenticity which were almost certainly excluded from earlier definitions but are now the core of my approach to leading. 

In completing my PLP coursework I have realized that the program was also an incredible opportunity for personal growth. I walk away from the program feeling as though my understanding, appreciation, and sensitivity towards people has greatly increased. I now realize that everyone's definition of leadership is different and how they implement or respond to the practice is likely going to vary significantly and thus it is crucial to recognize that people are the most important factor in leadership. 

Reflecting on my PLP experience has led me to appreciate the remarkable opportunity I had to be surrounded by a community of leaders that challenged me to consider and reconsider each opinion I had. While my Business Analytics courses have prepared me to thrive in a specific area, my leadership minor gives me the confidence to approach any situation and group of people with the skills necessary to be a leader. Some of my final thoughts on leadership are discussed in my Leadership Manifesto that is included on this page.
